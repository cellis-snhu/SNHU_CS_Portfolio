# CS 255 System Analysis and Design

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a company that works with new drivers to help them pass their theoretical and practical driving exams.

DriverPass requested a web-based system that could be used by customers and employees to schedule both online driver test practice and courses, along with in person training for the practical portion of driver's tests.

### What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did a particularly good job on the detailed architecture of the system. I was able to cover in detail many modern software and hardware components
that would be used to build a system like this, and also the implementation of modern
processes for how developers would not only build, but also rollout and maintain a
system like this including CI/CD, containerization, virtual servers, and managed
infrastructure on cloud providers.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would likely work on revising my initial designs as they were based on a cursory reading of the requirements. As I was able to dig into the requirements in more detail I found many places I would have like to iterate on my initial milestones and designs that contributed to the final project(s) presented in this class.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to do the difficult job of translating what the user thinks they're asking for with what they might actually be asking for. This is especially difficult with non-technical users as they will often describe something they may want, but in a way that is not an ideal use-case if they are not already familiar with the types of systems they are being interviewed for.

It is important to understand the user's needs as they are the one's who actually use the system, if they can't do what they need to then the design is a failure, whether it works well in a technical sense or not.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software, after acquiring the requirements the user might need and forming an idea of what they system will do, is to start with a small prototype that implements one core feature the user may need. After this I would present the system to the user in order to gain data and feedback on what they like, don't like, and things they may not understand in order to refine the system over time as other features are added.
